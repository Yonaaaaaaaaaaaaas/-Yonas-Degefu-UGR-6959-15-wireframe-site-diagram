        <article class="family">
          <h2>Family</h2>
            <p>I was born and raised in a town named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdP3ogKGFhQ&t=371s">Alem Gena</a> into a loving family. Although the town is fairly unknown, It is quite close to the capital which is really nice.</p>
            <p>I grew up in a family of six with 2 brothers and a sister. My parents instilled in me the values of hard work, dedication, and perseverance from young, and I think thats where I got my pitbullish trait of never giving up. Their unwavering support has been instrumental in shaping the man I am today and who I will be in the future.</p>

          <h2>Education</h2>
          <p>I attended school at <a href="http://www.faisalinc.com/login.php">Everst Youth Academy</a> where I developed a passion for programming during our IT lab sessions where our teacher would encourage us to try to code simple projects like hangman, a simple calculator and other stuff , which seem simple now but were absolutely horrifying at the time, using python.

          <h2>Achievements</h2>
          <p> Some of my achievements my mom brags about in our neighbourhood include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Being accepted to AAIT's Software department.</li>
              <li>Certificate of recognition for my 12th grade results.</li>
              <li>Finishing second in the Sheger city math competition</li>
              <li>Winning gold in our school's annual football tournament.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I like to believe I am a highly ambitious guy and although I have achieved some of my goals, I know there are still so many more left and as my highschool principal used to say <strong><em>Never let today's victory be the seed of tommorrow's downfall</em></strong>, but I am grateful for the opportunities I have had and the people who have supported me along the way. I am excited to see what the future holds and continue to grow both personally and professionally.
